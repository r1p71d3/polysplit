## Overview
Map quantization is the procedure of dividing a continuous map into a number of discrete regions. The simplest approach that has been used for hundreds of years is to overlap the map with a square grid. However, this approach ignores the geographical features of the map, making it suboptimal for certain applications. With this project, I would like to propose a novel algorithm that organically divides any given map into regions based on the relative travel time between different areas.

In its simple form, the proposed algorithm could be applied to a map (a polygon) with intraversible obstacles (holes). It works in 2 stages. In the first stage, the map is overlayed with a fine grid of $N$ points. Then, we calculate the shortest path (around the obstacles) betweeen every pair of points and construct the $N \times N$ distance matrix. In the second stage, we apply the k-medoids algorithm to the set of points, using the matrix from stage I as a distance function, and retrieve a set of $M$ centers. Finally, we construct a Voronoi graph around the centers, creating the regions.
